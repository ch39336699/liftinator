## üöÄ About

**Liftinator** is a fun opportunity to design, build, and test an elevator system. The concept seemed simple at first‚Äîjust a basic elevator that could move between different floors‚Äîbut I quickly realized it was an engaging exercise that required deep problem-solving, technical knowledge, and innovation. I would suggest starting with the [design document](), which gives an overview of the design and thought process when building the Lifinator. After cloning the repository, there are two ways to run the project.

- **Simple Setup**: Simple setup is basically running the install on the base POM file and then starting the services one at a time. This would get everything up and running fairly quickly.
- **Exciting Setup**: An exciting setup is deploying via Docker. An added bonus of running via a Docker container is that you can view the system via the Splunk dashboard.

## üìù Simple Setup
For simple setup, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository.
* Run **maven install** on the pom.xml the root directory of the project. This should first build **common-libs** and then build the **capacity-coordinator-service** and **edge-service**. If everything builds ok you should see:

* Run the spring services **capacity-coordinator-service** and **edge-service**  under **/apps** folder.
* With the services up you can now use the **http-request_demo.http** file in the base directory to send API commonds to run elevator requests.

## üìù Exciting Setup
For exciting setup, you must have Docker installed.
* Clone the repository.
* Run the **docker-compose.yaml** in the base directory. This will:
    1. Pull the docker images for the **capacity-coordinator-service** and **edge-service**
    2. Pull the docker images for **splunk** and **splunk/universalforwarder**
    3. Start all four containers. <br>
    **Note: Splunk server usually takes a few minutues to come up. Please be patient**
